* Operating-system-level virtualization, also known as containerization 
* Operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances
* Programs running inside a container can only see the container's contents and devices assigned to the container.

uses discrete kernel features like cgroups, namespaces, SELinux, and more.

OCI
---
* OCI ( open container initiative ) - Established in June 2015 by Docker and other leaders in the container industry
* OCI currently contains two specifications: the Runtime [Specification](http://www.github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) and the Image [Specification](http://www.github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

![OCI](https://i0.wp.com/blog.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/243938a0-856b-4a7f-90ca-2452a69a385c-1.jpg?w=1019&ssl=1)

OCI implementations:  
* [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)  
* [railcar](https://github.com/oracle/railcar) - Rust implementation  

let's start with [namespace](01-namespace/README.md)
